# accomplishments

Another two weeks of summer pass. I'm finding lots of ways to spend my time. Programming routine continues to be a struggle, but I'll do my best to keep it above a minimum pace.

* Engine:
  * Explosions introduced. 
  * Props substituted for more general Entities, which can be linked to a player or not.
  * The engine's responsibilities now depend on where it is the network -- explosions are only simulated client-side, for example.
  * Introduced SkyListener for injecting callbacks and custom logic into the Sky.
  * Plane sizes are gracefully scalable.
  * Introduced FlowControl to remedy latency fluctuation of multiplayer snapshots, on both clientside and serverside.
  * Beginning to link game graphics into the engine.
  * Revised and tuned flight mechanics. Things are much nicer now.
* Client:
  * TextLog is nicer, all animated and transparent.
  * Fully integrated Glenn's joyful joystick support.
  * We have real application settings now. Moved to the ui namespace because they are shared by the application launcher.
  * Introduced more expressive Printers, used to log various types of messages within the client.
  * Various critical fixes and cleanups in the Multiplayer client. 
  * MultiplayerView's job is more clearly defined. 
  * Improved sandbox and sandbox console.
  
# next steps

  * Continue checking off boxes for the alpha demo development release. Next step, more engine stuff.
