Summer continues to move along. A lot of time throughout the past two weeks was rudely appropriated for other activities, and in the week immediately past I haven't touched the code. Fortunately I've just come to my senses and am ready to kludge out another handful of essential features.

# accomplishments

* Expansion of the engine directory structure, introducing such great new areas as engine/sky/components and engine/sky/physics; partitioned and classified files accordingly.
* Added sky::Role to differentiate the operation of the engine based on where it is in the multiplayer network.
* Fixed and augmented various utilities. Cooldown's loss of a dimension of freedom and the addition of Scheduler are particularly notable.
* Improved spawn / suicide mechanics for safety and adherence to EU regulation.
* Added two new lines to the debug display. Don't think of me as a hero, I'm just an ordinary man.
* Added sky::Shapes for all our shapy needs, added support for the former in sky::Physics.
* Added sky::Component{Set} abstractions to make a place for all the sets of miscellaneous thingamabobs we need to synchronize and simulate.
* Introduced Entity, Explosion, HomeBase, and Zone in the new Component system.
* Introduced AutoNetwork, making delta collection give optional<> results everywhere.
* Added more tests.
* Fixed a few superficial issues with the polypartition library.

# next steps

Now that I've had my break from development, the next week would do nicely to be a little sprint. At this point, I have a bunch of game mechanics to start implementing.

I'll be taking a week and a half off for a more formal vacation starting August 29th.
