# accomplishments

Not much was accomplished this week in the way of development, due to a set of other obligations and a need to spend some time away from C++. I finished the last of my exams, which means I'm totally free from high school. Towards the end of the week I learned Rust through some toy projects, and played with the idea of porting our codebase to it -- but decided that this undertaking would be too much of a risk of my time and sanity. Perhaps I'll reconsider in the future, if after the development alpha release we still have no C++ programmers helping.

This coming week will be the end of serious time-consuming obligations for me (national rowing championship.)

# next steps

* Same as last week -- but this week, things are more likely to get done.
* (I've decided to use `libarchive` for our archiving needs. The C ecosystem is what C++ lives on, apparently.)
