# solemnsky manual

This directory contains a brief manual, describing the gist of solemnsky's design.
 It is divided into three sections:

 * engine.md: The core of solemnsky (`src/sky`, `src/util`).
 * client.md: The graphical client (`src/ui`, `src/client`).
 * server.md: The solemnsky server and modding interface (`src/server`).
